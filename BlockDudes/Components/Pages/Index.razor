<h1>Welcome to the marketplace of the future</h1>

<p>
    A marketplace that will drive financial inclusion and make peer-to-peer exchange of a commodity or a service on the blockchain possible by lowering the entry barriers
    <br />
    Value is created and exchanged between people on the network and the power lies in their hands to decide what is valuable for them.
</p>

<p>
    What can you do with us
    <br />
    With this prototype we can tokenize a commodity or a service that has potential value and make it tradeable on a decentralized marketplace.
</p>

<p>
    How can you do this
    <br />
    The approach is quite simple
    <ol>
        <li>
            Upload details about what you would like to trade
        </li>
        <li>
            Go to the marketplace to make a trade proposal
        </li>
        <li>
            Agree on the trade and execute this transaction on the blockchain
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>

    private void Login()

        if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(privateKey))
        {
            AccountService.AddAccount(privateKey);
            uriHelper.NavigateTo("/marketplace");
        }
    }
}
