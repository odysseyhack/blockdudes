## BlockDudes
### Marketplace of the future

A marketplace that will drive financial inclusion and make peer-to-peer exchange of a commodity or a service on the blockchain possible by lowering the entry barriers

Value is created and exchanged between people on the network and the power lies in their hands to decide what is valuable for them.


### What can you do with us

With this prototype we can tokenize a commodity or a service that has potential value and make it tradeable on a decentralized marketplace.
